BuDEE App : Electrical Engineering Design Buddy

BuDEE is a system that allow the user to calculate and manage the daily work of an electrical engineer more efficiently. Only by using a mobile phone, they can get an accurate calculation and cost estimation price for a cable construction. 

Unlike the traditional way, before this they need to calculate by using the formulae on the paper, which it could cost a lot of time just for a simple calculation. They also need to always key-in data in the Excel file to store the calculation data. 

This is such a hassle and waste of time to do a redundant effort on an easy job. BuDEE has made it easier for the electrical engineer to reduce the unnecessary physical work and they does not need to memorizing the formulae because the system can automatically calculate the data and cost estimation price by linking the formulae with the table in the database. 

The main advantage of this system is, it can produce a report from the calculation data and the report will be saved into the database. The user can easily view the past completed calculation data and the admin does not need to key-in the data manually anymore.
